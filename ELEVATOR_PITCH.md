# Elevator Pitch: Beli Apt PV

## 30-Second Version
*"Beli Apt PV is the Tinder for apartment hunting. Instead of swiping through endless apartment listings alone, friends can now swipe together in real-time sessions. Our AI-powered platform combines everyone's preferences to curate the perfect apartment list, then uses a tournament-style voting system to find the ideal place everyone can agree on. It's apartment hunting, but fun, collaborative, and actually effective."*

## 60-Second Version
*"Finding an apartment with roommates is a nightmare. Everyone has different preferences, budgets, and priorities, leading to endless debates and compromised decisions. Beli Apt PV solves this by turning apartment hunting into a collaborative game.

Here's how it works: Friends join a room with a simple 6-character code. Each person sets their preferences - budget, location, amenities, accessibility needs. Our AI agent then analyzes everyone's preferences and curates a personalized apartment list that balances all requirements. 

The magic happens in our tournament-style voting system. Instead of arguing over options, roommates swipe through apartment comparisons in real-time. Each vote is recorded, and the system uses a sophisticated ranking algorithm to identify the apartment that makes everyone happiest.

We've integrated with real apartment data and use Google's Gemini AI to ensure the selections are intelligent and personalized. The result? Faster decisions, happier roommates, and apartments everyone actually wants to live in.

The platform is already built with real-time collaboration, user authentication, and comprehensive preference tracking. We're solving a $50 billion market problem with a solution that's both practical and engaging."*
